Ansible Map Filter does two things:
-----------------------------------

1. It applies a filter on a sequence of objects
2. It looks up an attribute.

This is useful when dealing with lists of objects but you are really only interested in a certain value of it

The basic usage of map is to look up an attribute.  Letâ€™s cover it first

Example userdata
----------------

names: [ {
        "first": "Paul",
        "last": "Thompson",
        "mobile": "+1-234-31245543",
        "ctc": "100000",
        "address": {
          "city": "LasVegas",
          "country": "USA"
        }

{{ names | map(attribute='address') | map(attribute='city') }}
